# Canadian-yearly-Income-Estimator
I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed a new assignment and developed a groundbreaking model to predict Canada's per capita income for the year 2050. 

Using the power of data analysis and regression modeling, I harnessed the potential of past data to build a robust prediction model. This cutting-edge approach enables us to forecast the per capita income for Canadian citizens in the year 2050 with unprecedented accuracy.
